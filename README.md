# Horiseon Code Refactoring

To refactor this code, extensive changes to the HTML and CSS files were made:

    1. Fixed broken "Search Engine Optimization" link in navigation bar to reroute to that section on the main page.
    2. Consolidated CSS rules by deleting redundant classes and ID's.
    3. Added alt attributes to all images for accessability.
    4. Added comments on CSS code for future reference of source code functionality.
    5. Renamed HTML tags to follow semantic rules
